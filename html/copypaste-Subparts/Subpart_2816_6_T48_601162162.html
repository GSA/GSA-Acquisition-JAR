If at the end of the extension, the contracting officer and the contractor cannot negotiate a definitive contract because of failure to reach an agreement on price or fee, the procedures set forth in FAR 51.216-25, 16.603-2, 15.8, and part 31 shall be followed, as applicable.

Under circumstances of compelling urgency which do not permit the time needed for written approval, oral approval must be obtained; however, written documentation to support the award and confirm the oral approval must be submitted as soon as practicable after award.
