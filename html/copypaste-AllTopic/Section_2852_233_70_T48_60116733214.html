</p>
                                 <p class="p HD1">Protests Filed Directly With the Department of Justice (JAN 1998)
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) The following definitions apply in this provision:

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) “Deciding Official” means the person chosen by the protestor to decide the agency protest; it may be either the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official.

                                 <p class="p List2">(3) State whether the protestor chooses to have the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protestor is silent on this matter, the Contracting Officer will decide the protest.

                                 <p class="p List2">(5) Include the information required by FAR 33.103(a)(2):
</p>

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) An interested party filing a protest with the Department of Justice has the choice of requesting either that the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) The decision by the Agency Protest Official is an alternative to a decision by the Contracting Officer. The Agency Protest Official will not consider appeals from the Contracting Officer's decision on an agency protest.

The scheduling conference will establish deadlines for oral or written arguments in support of the agency protest and for many officials to present information in response to the protest issues. The deciding official may hear oral arguments in support of the agency protest at the same time as the scheduling conference, depending on availability of the necessary parties.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) Oral conferences may take place either by telephone or in person. Other parties may attend at the discretion of the deciding official.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(g) The protestor has only one opportunity to support or explain the substance of its protest. Department of Justice procedures do not provide for any discovery. The deciding official may request additional information from either the agency or the protestor.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(h) An interested party may rerpresent itself or be represented by legal counsel. The Department of Justice will not reimburse the protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(j) The deciding official will make a best effort to issue a decision on the protest within twenty (20) days after the filing date. The decision may be oral or written.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(k) The Department of Justice may dismiss or stay proceeding on an agency protest if a protest on the same or similar basis is filed with a protest forum outside the Department of Justice.</p>
